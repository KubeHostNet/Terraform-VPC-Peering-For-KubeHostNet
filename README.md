# Terraform VPC Peering For KubeHostNet 

Terraform VPC Peering For KubeHostNet is an open-source toolkit for connecting  
KubeHostNet with networks, clusters, and systems that are created and 
managed by KubeHostNet.  This project is a component of KubeHostNet, which will consume this.  
  
Terraform VPC Peering For KubeHostNet is comprised of Terraform modules and of 
calls to Terraform modules.  A number of these modules seem empty here on purpose.  
  
Automated processes in KubeHostNet will add and modify elements of the 
here-seemingly empty modules as part of the work of creating and managing dynamic 
cloud systems.  
  
The primary development of Terraform VPC Peering For KubeHostNet was done by
[Green River IT, Incorporated](http://greenriverit.com) in California.  It is released 
under the generous license terms defined in the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt) file.
